Give the gift of giving. Make a card and send a promise.

Why pay now, when you can do later?

| Created using Ruby on Rails, SQL, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. Started with wireframes and user stories to map out the user flow and requirements. I has been deployed to Heroku at https://altegifting.herokuapp.com/. First we worked on the pages and log-in/log-out feature. From there creating and editing user profiles. Creation of 'Cards' was an important feature, each Card can be created, viewed, edited or deleted. Future enhancement: Save card as an image and sent it in the email. |
