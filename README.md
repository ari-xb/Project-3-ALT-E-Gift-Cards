Give the gift of giving. Make a card and send a promise.

Why pay now, when you can do later?

| Allows people to sign up and create an e-card that is a promise to use their time to do something for the recipient, instead of an item bought with money. Created using Ruby on Rails, SQL, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. We started with creating an agile (Trello) board and adding cards to it, beginning with wireframes and user stories to map out the user flow and requirements. Then we worked on the various web pages and the session log-in/log-out feature. From there creating and editing user profiles. Creation of 'Cards' was an important feature, each Card can be created, viewed, edited or deleted. It has been deployed to Heroku at https://altegifting.herokuapp.com/. Future enhancement: Save card as an image and email it instead of a link. |
